# Bubble-Sort-Visualizer
A simple sorting visualizer which help us to understand how bubble sort works

Basically in sorting we use array, so here we convert the elements of array into bars like a bar-graph. 
So bigger the value of element, higher the length of bar .
A sound effect is also added , which will play while sorting the array.
